# README
This folder contains a try to implement the algorithm proposed by Wei Wang, Jing Dong and Tieniu Tan for image tampering detection based on stationary distribution of markov chain [1]. This is a method which focuses on features and then uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images. Datails can be found in the original.
